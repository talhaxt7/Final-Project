# Final-Project
Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard

This File contains the Code used to complete my Final Project Assignment of Webscraping Data and Creating Dashboards using Python.
This is a small project but the learning curve is quite great. An easy project to get hands on in using pandas, BeautifulSoup for Scraping, yfinance, and matplotlib, etc.
A fun Data science Project
